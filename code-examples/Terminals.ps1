# This really isnt a script, just some recommendations

# For Windows, use the Windows Terminal application. 
    # It can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store or from https://aka.ms/terminal for older OS's
    # It is included in Windows 11 22H2 and later as well as Server 2025 and later

# For MacOS, use iTerm2 (https://iterm2.com/) 
    # It is a free download and works great
